## TV Show Recommender

### Project Overview:
This project involves building a recommendation system for TV shows. Given user preferences for TV show features, the system recommends TV shows that the user is likely to enjoy. The core of the system is a predictive model that estimates a show's IMDb rating.

##### Features:
The dataset includes the following features for each TV show:
- Title: The title of the TV series.
- IMDb ID: The unique identifier for the series on IMDb.
- Release Year: The year in which the series was released.
- Genre: The genre(s) of the series.
- Cast: The main cast members of the series.
- Synopsis: A brief summary or description of the series.
- Rating: The average rating of the series on IMDb (scaled from 1 to 10).
- Runtime: The duration of each episode or the total runtime of the series.
- Certificate: The content rating or certificate assigned to the series (e.g., PG-13, TV-MA).
- Number of Votes: The total number of votes or ratings received by the series.
- Gross Revenue: The total gross revenue generated by the series (if available).

### Technologies Used:
- Python: The primary language used for implementing the recommendation system.
- DistilBERT: Used for embedding the 'Cast' and 'Synopsis' fields into numerical values that can be fed into the model.
- XGBoost: The machine learning algorithm used for predicting IMDb ratings.
- Flask API: Used for wrapping the recommendation system into a web application.

### Usage:
The project uses machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict the rating of a TV show based on its features. The user provides their preferred features and the system recommends TV shows that fit these preferences.

### CSV Files:
The dataset is organized into CSV files, each corresponding to a specific genre of TV series. Each file contains data about TV series in the respective genre, with the same feature set described above.

### How to Run:
Detailed instructions on how to run the project will be provided. The user will need to input their preferences, and the system will return recommended TV shows based on these preferences.

## Status: in progress
